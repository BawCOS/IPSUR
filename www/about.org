* What =IPSUR= is:

=IPSUR= is a textbook written for an undergraduate course in
probability and statistics. The approximate prerequisites are two or
three semesters of calculus and some linear algebra in a few places.
Attendees of the class typically include mathematics, engineering,
and computer science majors.

=IPSUR= is [[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html][FREE]], in the [[http://www.gnu.org/][GNU]] sense of the word. Hard copies are
available for purchase [[http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-using-r/8123594][here]] from Lulu. You may be able to get it
cheaper by downloading an electronic copy and printing it out
yourself.

I have been writing =IPSUR= on and off since 2006, yet there are many
important topics, examples, and exercises still missing from the book.
I will add them as time permits.
