Here are some links to things and places related to =IPSUR= which may
be of interest.

- [[http://www.lulu.com/shop/g-jay-kerns/introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-using-r/paperback/product-12037732.html][Here]] is where to buy a paperback hard-copy of the First Edition of
  =IPSUR=. I am thinking to migrate the Second Edition to Amazon but
  haven't decided yet.
- [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/ipsur.git][Here]] are the most recent commits to the bleeding-edge version of
  =IPSUR=.
- [[https://savannah.nongnu.org/git/?group=ipsur][Here]] is the project page on Savannah.
- [[https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=58][Here]] is the project page on R-Forge, where =IPSUR= development first
  started.
- [[https://github.com/gjkerns/IPSUR][Here]] is the project page on GitHub, where =IPSUR= development was
  after R-Forge, but before migration to Savannah.
- [[https://plus.google.com/+IPSURorg][Here]] is the Google+ page for IPSUR.

All three (3) of R-Forge, GitHub, and Savannah are up and running, but
I do most work on Savannah these days in support of the [[https://www.fsf.org/][Free Software
Foundation]]'s mission.

- [[http://www.ysumathstat.org/faculty/kerns/video/STAT3743/][Here]] is an entire semester's worth of lecture videos associated with
  the STAT 3743 course for which =IPSUR= was orignally written.
- [[http://www.ysumathstat.org/faculty/kerns/video/STAT3743/01-briefintroR/][Here]] is the first video in that series which demonstrates how to
  install R and get up and running with =IPSUR=.
- [[http://www.ysumathstat.org/faculty/kerns/video/STAT3743/02-RESOURCES/][Here]] are a bunch of additional resources associated with the course,
  including [[http://www.ysumathstat.org/faculty/kerns/video/STAT3743/02-RESOURCES/lectures/][lecture notes]] (in Beamer and handout format plus Sweave
  source) for the first few chapters plus some sample [[http://www.ysumathstat.org/faculty/kerns/video/STAT3743/02-RESOURCES/quizexam/][quiz and exam
  and lab assignments]].  All of the above distribute the source files,
  as well.
- There's even a [[http://www.ysumathstat.org/faculty/kerns/video/STAT3743/02-RESOURCES/IPSURRcmdr.pdf][manual for using IPSUR together with the R Commander]].
- Dr. Andy Chang recorded several YouTube videos: see [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rD96QW3BmU][here]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hKL_4tJNKQ][here]]
  and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE1nOH0uB0][here]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jMs7Cv83wA][here]] and...
